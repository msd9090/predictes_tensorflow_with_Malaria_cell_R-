# 🔬 Malaria Diagnosis: A Deep Learning Approach
This project focuses on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Medical Science. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in R, we aim to provide a rapid, automated tool for identifying Malaria-infected cells.

# 🦠 What is Malaria? (Scientific Overview)
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. When a patient is infected, these parasites enter the bloodstream and infect Red Blood Cells (RBCs).

Diagnostic Visual Cues:
Parasitized Cells: These cells contain visible "inclusions" or "spots" (often purple or dark-colored under Giemsa stain). They may show ring-like structures, which are the parasites multiplying inside the cell.

Uninfected Cells: Normal cells are clear, healthy-looking, and lack any dark spots or irregular internal structures.

Our AI model is designed to detect these microscopic differences that are sometimes missed by the human eye under fatigue.

# 📊 Dataset Information & Resource Access
The data required to run this model consists of thousands of high-resolution images. Due to storage limitations on GitHub, the full dataset and clinical documentation are hosted on Kaggle.
